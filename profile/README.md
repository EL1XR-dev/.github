>**EL1XR** is an open, modelling-first initiative that **designs, optimises, and governs future-proof, multi-vector energy systems**â€”delivering **open models, market insights, and deployable solutions** with real-world impact.

---

# Overview
**EL1XR** is an **open, modular ecosystem** of analytical tools for **modelling, planning, and operating zero-carbon energy systems**.
We provide a shared foundation for **data-driven policy analysis, market design, and decision-making**, focusing on electricity systems and their coupling with **heat, hydrogen, and mobility**.

Using methods from **mathematical optimisation, statistics, and computational science**, we build general-purpose tools for:  

- âš¡**Strategic planning** â€“ generation & transmission expansion, adequacy, investment analysis
- ðŸ› **Operation & Market** â€“ day-ahead, reserves, flow-based coupling, AC/DC power flows, flexibility integration (BESS, Hâ‚‚, DSM, EV/V2G)  
- ðŸŽ²**Risk and uncertainty** â€“ stochastic optimisation, Monte-Carlo stress testing, robust decisions under extreme conditions

**EL1XR* is an **independent, community-driven** effort and a **neutral hub for open-source energy-system research**.
We welcome contributions from academia, research institutes, system operators, and industry partners.
