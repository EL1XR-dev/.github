# IZERO Nexus

**Integrated Zero-carbon Energy Resource Orchestration for Smart Energy Systems**

---

## üåç Overview

**IZERO Nexus** is an **open, modular ecosystem of analytical tools** for modelling, planning, and operating **zero-carbon energy systems**.  
It provides a shared foundation to support **data-driven policy analysis, market design, and decision-making** in the energy transition ‚Äî with a focus on electricity systems and their coupling with other vectors such as **heat, hydrogen, and storage**.  

By employing techniques from **mathematical optimization, statistics, and computational science**, IZERO Nexus delivers flexible models for:  

- **Strategic planning** ‚Äì generation and transmission expansion, adequacy assessment, investment analysis  
- **Tactical operation** ‚Äì market clearing, operational reserves, AC/DC power flows, flexibility integration  
- **Risk and uncertainty** ‚Äì stochastic optimization, Monte Carlo stress testing, robust decision-making under extreme conditions  

IZERO Nexus is an **independent, community-driven initiative**, created to serve as a **neutral hub for open-source energy system research**.  
It welcomes contributions from academic institutions, research centers, and industry partners worldwide.  

IZERO Nexus supports the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals**, in particular:  
- **Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy**  
- **Goal 13: Climate Action**
